# Personal-Code-Bank
A place where the code I use across projects is stored.

Disclaimer:
My personal programming skills are limited to C# within the context of the Unity game engine. All code that is stored within this repository will be relevant to software development within Unity. My skill level is novice.

An attempt will be made to design the code that is stored here to be as general as possible so that it can more readily be applied to a number of projects with varying needs.
